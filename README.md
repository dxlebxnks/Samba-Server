Samba File Server on Proxmox Using Ubuntu

In this project, I set up a Samba file server on Ubuntu to enable seamless file sharing across a local network. The process involved configuring Ubuntu to function as a reliable and secure file server, accessible by various clients, including Linux, Windows, and macOS systems.

Steps Included:

Installing Ubuntu: I started by installing the latest version of Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS on a dedicated machine or virtual environment. The server was configured with essential updates and system settings to ensure stability and security.

Installing Samba: Using the Ubuntu package manager, I installed Samba, the software suite that allows file and print sharing between Unix/Linux and Windows machines.

Configuring Samba: I edited the Samba configuration file (smb.conf) to define shared directories, set access permissions, and configure network settings. This included setting up public and private shares, as well as specifying which users could access certain files.

User Management: I created and managed Samba users and groups, ensuring that each had the appropriate permissions to access the shared directories. This step was crucial for maintaining security and ensuring that only authorized users could access sensitive files.

Testing and Troubleshooting: After configuration, I tested the setup by connecting to the Samba shares from various operating systems. I resolved any connectivity or permission issues to ensure smooth operation across all clients.

Securing the Server: I implemented security measures such as setting up a firewall, enabling encrypted connections, and configuring Samba to use secure authentication methods.

This project resulted in a fully functional, secure Samba file server, capable of sharing files across different platforms efficiently. It provides a scalable solution for home or small office networks, ensuring that data is easily accessible yet secure.
